# fb-auto-login-no-more
Chrome extension to not stay logged into fb after closing a tab.

It's easy to open FB and start scrolling through the feed when you are bored sometimes.
What helps is logging out.
Facebook does not let you click a checkbox to indicate that you don't want to stay logged in.
You have to manually click on the log out button and then disable the option to one-click-log-in. 

This extension logs you out and removes one-click-log-in as soon as you close the tab.

*I still have to clean up some code here, so this is effectively v0.1*
