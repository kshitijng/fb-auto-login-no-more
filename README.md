# fb-auto-login-no-more
Chrome extension to not stay logged into fb after closing a tab.

As with most people, it's way too easy to open FB and start scrolling through the feed when you are bored sometimes.
What helps is logging out.
Incoveniently, facebook does not really let you click a checkbox to indicate that you don't want to stay logged in.
You have to manually click on the log out button and even then you have the option to one-click-log-in. 

This extension works around that by logging you out and removing one-click-log-in as soon as you close the tab.
So you have to manually put in your username and password everytime you come back. 

*I still have to clean up some code here, so this is effectively v0.1*

TODO: extend this to more popular websites, since there isn't a log of fb specific stuff on this.
